This particular assignment is intended as review and to help you (and me) find
out which areas of algebra you might need to practice on to get the most out of
this class.  The answers are in the back, but you should show all your work so
I can help diagnose any issues.
 
2.  Please submit this assignment on paper at the start of our next class
session, on March 14th.
