:summary: A review assignment on algebraic operations
:standards: algebra, order of operations

1. From the book

   Sec. 0.2:  # 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 49

   Sec. 0.3:  # 1, 3, 9, 11, 21, 23, 33, 59

   Sec. 0.5:  # 1, 7, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 53, 69

   Sec. 0.6:  # 1, 9, 11, 13, 59

2. This may seem like a long assignment -- 29 questions from the book.
However, if it takes you 5 minutes per question, this would be about 2.5 hours
of work, which is a little bit *less* than the amount of time you should expect
to spend working outside of class between each session.  If you ever find that
you spend less than 2 hours outside of class between sessions, you should look
for more ways to practice -- talk to me if you need help finding some.  On the
other hand, if you find you spend much more than 3.5 - 4 hours between
sessions, you might nbenefit from coming to office hours or contacting me via
email to see if I can help you get unstuck.

You should be working hard outside of class, but it shouldn't take you all
night, either.  

This particular assignment is intended as review and to help you (and me) find
out which areas of algebra you might need to practice on to get the most out of
this class.  The answers are in the back, but you should show all your work so
I can help diagnose any issues.
 
3.  Please submit this assignment on paper at the start of our next class
session.
