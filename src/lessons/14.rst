1. Demonstrate Desmos on solving system of equations from last time 

2. Create a system of equations problem with two variables (x & y)
3. Solve it (find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints)
4. Solve it again for much larger values (same matrix, different solutions) using the matrix inverse method.
5. Present to class, use Desmos to *see* the solutions

6. Create a system with three variables (x, y and z)
7. Solve it using inverse

8. What about a different kind of constraint?  I have a maximum I want to spend -- how could I display that? Start with two employees, add more.
